## Youtube Video - https://youtu.be/J2ej2BU4VNE

## üóíÔ∏è Overview

The **Contact Management** feature helps users organize and maintain essential customer/client contact information in one place. This feature is designed to allow users to add, view, update, and delete contacts quickly and efficiently. It is especially useful in business settings where managing relationships and customer data is key to growth and success. 

This contact management system provides a smooth experience for users to store, update, and retrieve contact details like name, email, phone number, company, and job title, ensuring seamless communication and relationship-building with clients and customers.

### Use Cases
- **Adding a New Contact**: Users can enter details such as name, email, phone number, company, and job title to create a new contact.
- **Viewing Contacts**: Contacts are displayed in an easy-to-read table with sorting and pagination to handle large lists.
- **Editing Contact Information**: Users can update contact details (e.g., new phone number or company) to keep their records accurate and up-to-date.
- **Deleting a Contact**: Outdated or incorrect entries can be removed to maintain a clean contact list.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

- **Frontend (ReactJS)**:
  - Contact form with MUI components for smooth input handling.
  - Table view of contacts with sorting, pagination, and CRUD operations.
  - Dynamic handling of the edit and delete actions for each contact.

- **Backend (NodeJS)**:
  - REST API with endpoints to add, update, retrieve, and delete contacts.
  - Error handling and validation for the API to ensure smooth user experience.
  - Use of MongoDB for storing contact data.

- **Database**:
  - MongoDB was chosen due to its flexibility in handling dynamic schemas and ease of use for small-scale applications like this CRM feature.

## üí° Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Dynamic Form Handling
- The form had to dynamically capture and handle various contact details. I used controlled components in React to manage the state of form inputs and ensure that data is correctly captured and submitted.

### Challenge 2: Integrating the Backend API with the Frontend
- Initially, there was some difficulty in making seamless requests from the frontend to the backend. This was resolved by setting up **Axios** for API requests and ensuring proper error handling for API failures.

### Challenge 3: Managing State Between Components
- Managing the state across multiple components (form, table, etc.) was tricky at first. This was solved by passing functions like `fetchContacts` and states like `contacts` between components as props.
